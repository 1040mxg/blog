[Kaggle Notebook:](https://www.kaggle.com/mxg1040/getting-started-with-titanic)
Initial score: 0.77511 ||
Score with modified dataset: 0.77511 (remained same)

## What was changed:
Missing data on passenger ages were filled in using the following methodology:
1) Split passengers up by class and gender in the following categories: male1, male2, male3, mrs1, mrs2, mrs3, miss1, miss2, miss3, operating under the assumption that ages would vary for married and unmarried women.
2) Missing data filled in with median age for all categories

## Considerations:
Despite filling in quite a bit of missing data, the score did not change at all. This seems to suggest that either age had little to do with survival, or the fact that the median age for all groups was young ended up skewing results. Either way, missing data seems to play a fairly minor role in results.
